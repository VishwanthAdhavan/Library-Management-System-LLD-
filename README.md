# 📚 Library Management System

This project is a **low-level design** for a Library Management System (LMS) that enables efficient management of books and members.

## ✨ Problem Statement

- Users to borrow up to **5 books** for **30 days**.
- Admins to manage books (add, update, remove).

- View all books and all members.

### 👥 User Actions:
- Sign up to become a member.
- Borrow and return books.
- Search for books by title, author, or genre.
